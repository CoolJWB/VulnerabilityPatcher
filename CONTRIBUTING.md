## How to contribute to VulnerabilityPatcher
When you want to contribute to this project make sure that you [make an issue](https://github.com/CoolJWB/VulnerabilityPatcher/issues) (don't be shy) before you make the pull request.
If the issue is accepted you fork the latest commit to the project and make your changes. The changes made must be in [Stroustrup style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Variant:Stroustrup) and follow the basic pattern of the plugin.
When the code is done you push it to your fork and then make a pull request, I will review your changes and either merge it or close it without merging (reason will be given).
